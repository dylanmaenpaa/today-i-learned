## Web development

### Nginx
Why should one use Nginx?

* **Reverse proxy**, forward requests to desired servers.
* **SSL termination**, handle SSL termination outside of the application. Changing protocol from http to https inside e.g. a node.js application is not so easy and might introduce security flaws.
* **gzip compression**, handle this outside of the application.
* **Performance benefits**, by letting Nginx handle SSL termination and gzip compression, performance benefits can be acquired. Caching can also be done in Nginx.
* **Reduce application code complexity**, instead of handling e.g. SSL termination and gzip compression inside the application code itself, we reduce the application code complexity.

## Docker

### Alpine images
By removing unnecessary dependencies, the images can be much smaller in size and reduce security threats. Smaller size also might give faster builds. 

### Non-root user
Run the docker daemon as non-root user to mitigate potential vulnerable security risks. One risk is that if the user running the daemon root, malicious code might enable root access to the host machine.

## Devops

### Continous integration
When changes are pushed to the main branch, a build happens. Tests are then ran to ensure the new changes are valid.

### Continous delivery
Continous delivery brings an addition to continous integration. By automating the release process, you can easily deploy an application by clicking a button.

### Continous deployment
Continous deployment brings an addition to continous delivery. The deployment is done automatically without having to press a button as long as the prerequisites such as tests are ok.
